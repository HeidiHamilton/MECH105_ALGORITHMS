This algorithm uses the bisection method. The bisection method is a numerical algorithm that finds the root of a function by repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. This is done until a desired level of accuracy is reached.

Inputs needed:
-The function you want to find the root of
-The interval that contains the root (specified by two endpoints, a and b)
-The desired tolerance, which determines how close the final estimate of the root should be to the true root.

Outputs produced:
- An estimate of the root of the function within the given interval that satisfies the specified tolerance.
