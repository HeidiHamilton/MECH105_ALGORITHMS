This algorithm uses the bisection method. The bisection method is a numerical algorithm that finds the root of a function by repeatedly dividing an interval in half and checking which half contains the root. This is done until a desired level of accuracy is reached.

Inputs needed:
1. The function you want to find the root of
2. The interval that contains the root (specified by two endpoints, a and b)
3. The desired tolerance, which determines how close the final estimate of the root should be to the true root.

Outputs produced:
- An estimate of the root of the function within the given interval that satisfies the specified tolerance.

**This algorithm can be used to solve for the root of the given function.**
