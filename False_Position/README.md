This is an algorithm for false position. False position is a numerical algorithm that finds the root of a function by approximating it with a linear interpolation and iteratively adjusting the interval based on the sign of the function at the approximation. 

Inputs:

1.  The function you want to find the root of
2. Two initial points that bracket the root (i.e., the function has opposite signs at the two points)
3. A tolerance level for determining when the approximation is "close enough" to the root

Outputs:
1. An estimate of the root of the function that satisfies the specified tolerance
2. Approximate relative error
3. Number of iterations used

**This algorithm can be used to solve for the root of the given function. The false position method involves drawing a straight line connecting the two endpoints of the interval and finding the point where this line intersects the x-axis. This point serves as the initial guess for the root. We then evaluate the function at this point and check whether it has the same sign as the function at the endpoints. If it does, we replace the endpoint with the guess. We continue this process until we converge to an approximation of the root within a specified tolerance. This can be useful for functions such as f(x) = cos(x) - x within the interval [0, 1].**
