This is an algorithm for solving for the volume of a given tank with specific dimensions.

Inputs:

1. Height of water
2. Height of cylinder
3. Height of cone
4. Radius of cylinder
5. Radius of cone

Outputs:

1. Volume of water

**An example of when this algorithm can be useful is to solve for the volume of water for a cylinder and cone system when given various heights of the water level.**
