This is an algorithm for a function that produces a special matrix that follows the specified criteria. The criteria given was: The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column, the value of each element in the first column is the number of the row and the rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.

Inputs:

1. Number of rows
2. Number of columns

Outputs:
1. Special matrix matching criteria

**This algorithm is useful for this specific prompt. It shows how a matrix can be adjusted to match wanted values that are given.**
