This is an algorithm for Linear Regression. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be described by a linear equation, and uses this equation to make predictions about the dependent variable based on values of the independent variable(s).

Inputs:

1. A set of data points consisting of one or more independent variables and a dependent variable
2. A model type, either "simple" for a single independent variable or "multiple" for multiple independent variables
3. A method for fitting the model, such as ordinary least squares (OLS)

Outputs:

1. The coefficients of the linear equation, which describe the slope and intercept of the line
2. The R-squared value, which indicates the goodness of fit of the model
