This is an algorithm for Linear Regression. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be described by a linear equation, and uses this equation to make predictions about the dependent variable based on values of the independent variable(s).

Inputs:

1. x: x-values for our data set
2. y: y-values for our data set

Outputs:
1. Slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
2. Intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
3. Rsquared: (coefficient of determination)

**This algorithm can be used to model the relationship between two variables. It is often used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another variable. This algorithm can be used to predict the price of a particular stock based on its historical performance, as well as the performance of the overall stock market. In this case, the stock price would be the dependent variable, while the historical performance of the stock and the overall stock market would be the independent variables. We could collect historical data on the stock price, the performance of the stock, and the performance of the overall stock market, and then use linear regression to model the relationship between these variables..**
