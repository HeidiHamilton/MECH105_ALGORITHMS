This is an algorithm for Linear Regression. Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that the relationship between the variables can be described by a linear equation, and uses this equation to make predictions about the dependent variable based on values of the independent variable(s).

Inputs:

1. x: x-values for our data set
2. y: y-values for our data set

Outputs:
1. Slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
2. Intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b
3. Rsquared: (coefficient of determination)

**This algorithm can be used to model the relationship between two variables. It is often used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another variable. This lineear regression code can be used to estimate values of a given function when related through a linear relationship.**
