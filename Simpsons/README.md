This is an algorithm for the Simpson's 1/3 rule. Simpson's 1/3 rule is a numerical method used to estimate the area under a curve by approximating it with a quadratic polynomial.

Inputs:

1. The function you want to integrate
2. The limits of integration
3. The number of subintervals to use (which should be even)

Outputs:

1.  An estimate of the definite integral of the function over the specified interval

**This algorithm can be used to approximate the area under the curve of a function using a quadratic polynomial. The curve is divided into an even amount of equally spaced intervals, and within each interval, a quadratic function is fitted to approximate the curve. It uses a weighted average of the function values at the endpoints and midpoint of each sub-interval to calculate the area of the parabolic approximation. Using this approach, the integral of an equation such as f(x)=x^3 between [0,2] can easily be solved.**
