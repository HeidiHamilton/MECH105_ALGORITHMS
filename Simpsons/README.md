This is an algorithm for the Simpson's 1/3 rule. Simpson's 1/3 rule is a numerical method used to estimate the area under a curve by approximating it with a quadratic polynomial.

Inputs:

1. The function you want to integrate
2. The limits of integration
3. The number of subintervals to use (which should be even)

Outputs:

1.  An estimate of the definite integral of the function over the specified interval
