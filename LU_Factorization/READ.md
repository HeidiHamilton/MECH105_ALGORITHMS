This is an algorithm for LU Factorization. LU factorization with pivoting is a numerical algorithm used to decompose a square matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix, with possible pivoting to ensure numerical stability.

The LU factorization with pivoting algorithm works by selecting a pivot element, usually the largest element in the current column, and using it to eliminate the entries below it in the column. This process is repeated for each column, resulting in a lower triangular matrix L and an upper triangular matrix U.

Inputs:

1. The square matrix you want to factorize
2. A tolerance level for determining when an entry in the matrix is "small enough" to be treated as zero (to avoid division by zero)
The code will output the following:

1. The lower triangular matrix L, stored in the lower triangle of the factorized matrix output
2. The upper triangular matrix U, stored in the upper triangle of the factorized matrix output
3. A permutation matrix P, which keeps track of the row exchanges performed during pivoting to ensure numerical stability

**This algorithm is often used in solving systems of linear equations, especially for large matrices. Once the LU decomposition is obtained, the system of equations can be solved efficiently by forward and backward substitution. This is because triangular matrices are easy to solve using these methods. It is also used in many numerical algorithms such as the computation of determinants and matrix inversion.**
