This is an algorithm for solving for the charge of a given electrical circuit.

Inputs:

1. t = time
2. q0 = initial charge
3. R = the resistance
4. L = inductance
5. C = capacitance

Outputs:

1. Final charge

**An example of when this algorithm can be used it to solve for the change in charge if the capacitor increases by a factor of 10.**
