This is an algorithm for plotting an expected degreadation graph of bromide. It produces a plot of the experimental function and the expected function.

Inputs:

1. Experimental data
2. Time period

Outputs:
1. Graph displaying two lines

**This is useful for comparing experimental data with the predicted values of bromide degradation.**
